 \chapter{Future work}\label{cha:future}
 There are some issues which could be interesting for future work in this thesis work. They are presented in this section.\\
 \\
\textbf{Lambda limitation}: Now the engine works only in the condition when lambda is equal to one. High lambda simulation will be interesting to be implemented with development of Oxygen fraction state or other air component vector. Investigating how EGR rate performs in different situations.\\
\\
\textbf{More advanced controllers}: A more advanced controller can be developed to have good dynamic feedback instead of static feedback. An advanced tuning method which can be automatic as a interesting topic for investigation.  \\
\\
\textbf{Reference values generation}: Oscillations lead to a result of the reference value oscillation when step response performs in different pedal positions. A more clear and effective investigation can be done to identify how sensitive analysis can help for improvement of control system.  \\
\\
\textbf{Delay time implement and advanced engine step response}: According to the performance of engine step response in long route EGR, there should be a time delay since it needs more time for the mass flow through the whole pipe for exhaust gas recirculated in reality. More measurement data need to be compared in order to have more accurate contribution. \\
\\
\textbf{Driveline implementation}: To implement this thesis into a basic driveline with clutch, Vehicle and drive model can be interesting for next investigation. Moreover, a lot of drive cycle can be compared and the fuel consumption can be determined as well to prove the EGR function. EGR rate condition needs to be considered to give more suitable strategy to control the engine. \\
